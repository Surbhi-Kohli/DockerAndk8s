Virtualization:
Technique of splitting/adding physical resources into as many logical resources as we want.

You may have a mobile phone with internal memory:32 gb and u have a memory card of 16gb.In case u want to download a movie of 40 gb, you wont be 
able to download it as such, unless u choose to use ur memory card as an internal memory.(Virtualisation with adding resources).
In case if u now remove ur sd card, ur whole memory gets corrupted.
