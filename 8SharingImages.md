## Sharing Images
We share images and not containers.We can share a dockerfile , based on which an image can be build and container can be created.That can be one way.
Better way would be to share the image itself.

## Pushing images to DockerHub
We can push the images to docker hub or a private registry.DockerHub is the official docker image registry.

Pushing/pulling to private registry would require url details of the private registry.
